Hi, I’m Anav Gusain

I am a Computer Science & Engineering undergraduate (B.Tech, 6th semester) with a focused interest in Machine Learning and applied AI systems. I work on transforming data and algorithms into production-ready models and usable applications, with an emphasis on correctness, scalability, and interpretability.

My experience includes building end-to-end ML pipelines — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment. I have implemented projects such as diabetes prediction systems, sentiment analysis models, and ML-powered applications using Streamlit, backed by MySQL databases.

Technically, I work primarily with Python, and have hands-on experience with machine learning fundamentals, supervised learning algorithms, model evaluation techniques, and basic MLOps practices. Alongside ML, I maintain strong foundations in DSA, DBMS, and software engineering principles, enabling me to design reliable AI systems rather than isolated models.

Currently, I am deepening my knowledge of advanced ML concepts, system design for AI applications, and preparing for ML / AI Engineer roles through continuous project-based learning.

Focused on building reliable, data-driven AI solutions with real-world impact.
